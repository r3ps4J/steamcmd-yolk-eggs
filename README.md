# steamcmd-yolk-eggs
A repository containing Pterodactyl eggs that use [r3ps4J/steamcmd-yolk](https://github.com/r3ps4J/steamcmd-yolk). These eggs should support both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures and utilise the provided steamcmd installation from [cm2network/steamcmd](https://github.com/CM2Walki/steamcmd) or [sonroyaalmerol/steamcmd-arm64](https://github.com/sonroyaalmerol/steamcmd-arm64) based on the architecture.

Most eggs are based on their equivalent in https://github.com/pelican-eggs/games-steamcmd.

*Note that most of the eggs included in this repository were made for my own use. Feel free to open issues, but I may not have time to address them.*
